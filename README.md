# Kaffemaskinen

A React app to demonstrate simple programming skills.

The app has a basic React.js frontend that is integrated into a AWS serverless backend.

Very simple code and css.

The backend uses API Gateway, Lambda and Dynamo DB.

The [lambda function](backendLambda.js) is very simple and included in this repo, not deployable from here though.

Add and search the Kaffemaskinen database.

No tests included.

Also very little validation and error handling.
